                <h3 class="major">Student Assistent</h3>
                <p>
                  During my time as a Student Assistant at North West University from February 2024 to June 2024, I played an integral role in supporting the CMPG 111 Python module. My primary responsibilities included assisting students with their assignments and coding challenges, ensuring they had a clear understanding of the concepts being taught. I provided guidance and clarification on complex topics, helping students develop their problem-solving skills and confidence in programming.

                <p>

This role allowed me to enhance my communication and leadership skills, as I regularly interacted with students, offering them feedback and encouragement. My experience in this position has deepened my knowledge of Python and reinforced my commitment to education and mentoring.
